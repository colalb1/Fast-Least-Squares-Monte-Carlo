# Fast Least Squares Monte Carlo
Fast implementation of Least-Squares Monte Carlo aka Longstaff Schwartz in C++. This project is in early stages.

The original Longstaff Schwartz implementation was provided by [R.S.](https://rsree.ise.illinois.edu/Prof._R.S._Sreenivas_%28Main%29.html) of the UIUC Industrial Engineering Department. I will be modifying this code and augmenting the method.


## My Review of C++
Fast. Also makes me want to scoop my eyes out.
